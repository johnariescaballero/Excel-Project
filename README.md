Project Overview
This project features a comprehensive Summary Dashboard built to analyze Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and ticket volumes across multiple service sites and contact channels. The goal is to identify friction points in the customer journey and provide actionable insights for service recovery.

Key Features
Dynamic Slicers: Filter by Site, Brand (Meta Quest, Rayban, Meta Portal), Solved Status, and Pareto Groupings.

Dual-Axis Visualization: Compares Survey Volume (Bar) against NPS (Line) to visualize the impact of scale on customer satisfaction.

Driver Analysis: Breaks down sentiment by specific issues such as Hardware Orders, Digital Orders, and Technical Issues.

Channel Performance: Tracks NPS across WhatsApp, Email, Chat, and Salesforce integrations.

Key Insights (Current View)
Channel Criticality: In the current "Rayban - Pending" view, the Salesforce channel shows a bottom-out NPS of -100.00, indicating a total breakdown in customer satisfaction for that specific funnel.

High-Volume Friction: Hardware Orders represent the highest volume driver for Site 2 (115 surveys) but carry a low NPS of -38.26, highlighting a need for fulfillment process improvements.

Technical Red Flags: "Display/Visual Issues" in Site 2 shows the most severe sentiment drop among drivers at -81.82.

Tech Stack
Tool: Microsoft Excel (Advanced Pivot Tables, Power Query, and Slicers).

Data Source: customerSurveyProject.xlsx.

Version Control: GitHub.
